# Currency Converter
A simple HTML/PHP currency converter using online webservices 

## Setup
The program was build on a Windows machine using XAMPP as Apache server. In order to execute the program, the folder should be accesible from a webserver with the URL: <host>/veldsink/. E.g. localhost/veldsink/. Otherwise, the HOME_URL in the Auth class should be edited to point to the right url. 

Database credentials can be edited as well in the Auth class. Also, the database must be imported. 

Other than that, the app should be good to go.
